This plugin contains the SDQ workflow engine used to run activities which consist of a set of actions. It provides several abstract classes that can be used when creating a workflow and that provide helpful template methods. 

The plugin is Eclipse dependent because it uses the Eclipse CoreException and several other UI features.
